## Hola amiguitos

This branch is for building TWRP recovery & derivatives, based on my crDroid kernel fork for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

TWRP-related commits adapted from work by:
* nebrassy <nebras30@gmail.com>
* siddhrsh <skoyande17@gmail.com>
* others I'm sure (like, y'know, mauronofrio <poronofrio@gmail.com>)
* ...and the financial support of viewers like you!

Rebased on the official lineage-18.1 branch from LineageOS as of September 2021, with some extra goodies added in like clang-12+ support, multiple vibration type support, wireguard support, and battery-idle-mode-enabled charging switches.
